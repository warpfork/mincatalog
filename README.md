==========

This repo contains a [Warpforge](http://warpforge.io) catalog filesystem with a very minimal number of "base images" sometimes used in bootstrapping and demos of warpforge.

### What's a Catalog?

It's a data structure that maps human-readable names to Warpforge WareIDs.

See https://warpforge.notion.site/Catalogs-f53f2c9a2f0b4a8ba4d55d5f52997555 for more information about catalogs.

### What's the policy for this Catalog?

This catalog is a very minimal one, and probably won't grow often.

We want this one to remain small so that it can be used in demo environments and always be inexpensive to reference.

If you're looking for places to publish data from projects you're working on, it's probably not here :)  You can publish your own catalogs anywhere :)
